ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the latin alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome.

So the text cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_Ncualgvd} when rotated basically becomes

picoCTF{next_time_I'll_try_2_rounds_of_rot13_Aphnytiq}, which is the flag.
