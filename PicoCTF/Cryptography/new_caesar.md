The given file had : **picoCTF{dspttjohuifsvcjdpoabrkttds}**.


Caeser cipher of **dspttjohuifsvcjdpoabrkttds** directly did not work. 
Used https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher to get all combinations and the +1 Rotation gave **crossingtherubiconzaqjsscr** which was the only one with actual english words. 
Tried that and it worked.
